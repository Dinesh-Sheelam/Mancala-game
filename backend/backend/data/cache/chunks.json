History of Mancala Mancala is one of the oldest known board games in the world. It is not a single game, but a family of strategy games that share similar mechanics involving the sowing and capturing of seeds or stones. The origins of Mancala trace back more than 1,300 years to Africa. Archaeological evidence of Mancala boards has been discovered carved into stone surfaces in regions such as Ethiopia, Eritrea, and ancient Egypt. Through trade routes and cultural exchange, Mancala spread to the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. Different regions developed their own variations of the game. The name 'Mancala' comes from the Arabic word 'naqala', meaning 'to move'. Common regional names for Mancala games include Oware, Kalah, Bao, and Sungka. 2.

Special Rules • Extra Turn Rule: If the last seed of a turn lands in the player’s store, the player gets another turn. • Capture Rule: If the last seed lands in one of the player’s own empty pits, and the opposite pit contains seeds, the player captures all seeds from the opposite pit along with the last seed placed. These captured seeds are placed into the player’s store. 7. Ending the Game The game ends when one player’s six pits are completely empty. The other player then collects all remaining seeds from their pits and places them into their store. All seeds in both stores are counted, and the playe",

The player with the most seeds in his/her store at the end of the game wins. Set Up: Place four seeds in each of the six pits on your side of the game board. Your opponent should do the same. The colors of the seeds don’t matter. (For a shorter game, you can play with three seeds in each pit.) Playing: Basic Rules: * Play always moves around the board in a counter-clockwise circle (to the right) * The store on your right belongs to you. That is where you keep the seeds you win. * The six pits near you are your pits. * Only use one hand to pick up and put down seeds. * Once you touch the seeds in a pit, you must move those seeds. * Only put seeds in your own store, not your opponent’s store. Starting the Game: On a turn, a player picks up all the seeds in one pit and “sows” them to the right, placing one seed in each of the pits along the way. If you come to",

If you come to your store, then add a seed to your store and continue. You may end up putting seeds in your opponent’s pits along the way. Play alternates back and forth, with opponents picking up the seeds in one of their pits and distributing them one at a time into the pits on the right, beginning in the pit immediately to the right. Special Rules: *When the last seed in your hand lands in your store, take another turn. *When the last seed in your hand lands in one of your own pits, if that pit had been empty you get to keep all of the seeds in your opponents pit on the opposite side. Put those captured seeds, as well as the last seed that you just played on your side, into the store. Ending the Game: The game is over when one player’s pits are completely empty. The other player takes the seeds remaining in her pits and puts those seeds in her store.",
